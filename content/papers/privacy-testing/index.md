##### Abstract:

How reliably do synthetic data from machine learning generators protect the privacy of the original data? We first review the empirical testing of privacy in machine learning, focusing on the intuitions for and assumptions behind such tests. We then discuss whether and how these tests could be used when evaluating generative algorithms for deployment at statistical agencies and in the health care system. Privacy audits assume strong adversaries and can identify bugs in the training algorithm. They could thus become standard in ensuring the correct implementation of a given algorithm. Membership inference attacks assume realistic threat scenarios, but they do not scale in the size of the training data. Their ability to consider the specific context of releasing privacy-sensitive models could make them informative for practitioners---if the scaling challenge is solved. We suggest some ideas for future work and discussion in this direction.
