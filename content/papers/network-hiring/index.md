##### Abstract:

We study the role of collaboration networks in the U.S. market for early-
career scientists. In 2014, about 21% of PhD graduates found their first job
at a university where their advisor had a co-author---a threefold increase from
1990. Such connections more than double the probability of finding a job at a
given university, even after controlling for unobserved factors at the level of PhD
class–hiring university pair and for the topical fit between the PhD graduate’s
dissertation and research at the hiring university. We observe a sizable citation
premium for graduates placed through the advisor’s network. However, when comparing 
graduates hired at the same university, the productivity premium is fully
explained by public information on the productivity of the PhD graduate and their
advisor at the time of graduation. These results suggest that PhD advisors do not
convey additional private information about match quality or the PhD graduate’s
productivity in their collaboration network. While the estimated role of network-
based placements has doubled from 1990 to 2014, the citation premium for network
hires has remained constant.
