      <description>We study a reform that eased cross-border commuting from France to the high-wage Swiss labor market. The results thus show that if labour supply is elastic enough, the local labour market can expand and absorb additional competition for workers.</description>

      <description>We review the empirical testing of privacy in machine learning, focusing on the intuitions for and assumptions behind such tests. We then discuss whether and how these tests could be used when evaluating generative algorithms for deployment at statistical agencies and in the health care system. </description>

      <description>We study the role of collaboration networks for placing PhD students in the U.S. We find a substantial and rising role for network hiring. For graduates placed via the advisor&amp;#39;s network, we document a citation premium of 9 to 30 percent but find no evidence of private information being revealed. </description>
